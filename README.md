'# Quality assessement of ground-based irradiance measurement for PV
Procedures to assess and improve irradiance measurement quality for photovoltaic system are explored in this project.
The analysis outcome were used to review and finalise the PhD thesis.

# The Mission (Why)
1. Explore not enough documented and described datasets
1. Perform remote analysis on them
1. Share interim results 
1. Receive feedback on most important issues
1. Implement strictly necessary improvements
1. Create data visualizations for the PhD thesis

## Features (What)
Hereby follow the project description.

### Project architecture
Project architecture is organised in the following folders:
1. "irradiance_examples_ipynb": Jupyter notebooks for the visualisation of the results.
1. "irradiance_source_py": contains the main modules used by the files in "irradiance_examples_ipynb", eventually used also by the files in "pv_module_examples_ipynb"
1. "pv_module_examples_ipynb": Jupyter notebooks for the visualisation of the results.
1. "pv_module_source_py": contains the main modules used by the files in "pv_module_examples_ipynb". The folder may contain files more updated than the ones in "irradiance_source_py"
1. Other various "_py" folders: python module not linked to Jupyter notebooks. Descriptions are generally available as README.md


# Who did the project (Who):
Current contributor : Francesco Mariottini (FM)

# Development (How)

## Communication and Management
FM set up the private repository and taking care of all the development.

## Thesis writing
Most important analysis results were implemented into the thesis writing.

# Future improvements
