# Quality assessement of ground-based irradiance measurement for PV
Procedures to assess and improve irradiance measurement quality for photovoltaic system are explored in this project.
The analysis outcome will be used to review and finalise the PhD thesis.

# The Mission (Why)
1. Explore not enough documented and described datasets
1. Perform remote analysis on them
1. Share interim results 
1. Receive feedback on most important issues
1. Implement strictly necessary improvements
1. Create data visualizations for the PhD thesis

## Features (What)
Hereby follow the project description.

### Project architecture
Project architecture is organised in the following folders:
1. ".idea": developing environment created by Pycharm
1. "docs": instructions and workflows to help supervisor(s)
1. "examples": interim results
1. "source": developed python modules
1. "test": playground for not released code

# Who did the project (Who):
Current contributor : Francesco Mariottini (FM)

# Development (How)

## Communication and Management
FM set up the private repository and taking care of all the development.

## Thesis writing
Most important analysis results are implemented into the thesis writing.

# Future improvements 
Code is publicly available.
 
# Data analysis (When)
- Repository: `ground_based_solar_irradiance`
- Type of Challenge: `Analysis and visualisation for the PhD thesis`
- Duration: ``1 person`` plus not quantified supervisors feedback
- Deadline: `30/08/2021`
